# Stroke-Patience-Analysis

This project will:
* Discovered physiological, behavioral, and regional patterns of stroke patients from the dataset with
Tableau and constructed regression models to predict patients at high risk of stroke in R.
* Employed cluster comparison analysis to uncover relationships between stroke likelihood and
predictors such as hypertension, smoking status, age, and job types.
* Developed visualization reports and dashboards using Tableau that display the stroke likelihood of
patients and allow adjustments to variables like region, gender, and marital status.
